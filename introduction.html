    <p align=justify>Travel is the movement of people between distant geographical locations. Travel can be done by foot, bicycle, automobile, train, boat, bus, airplane,     ship or other means, with or without luggage, and can be one way or round trip. Travel can also include relatively short stays between successive            movements, as in the case of tourism.</p>
    <p align=justify>The origin of the word "travel" is most likely lost to history. The term "travel" may originate from the Old French word travail, which means 'work'.     According to the Merriam Webster dictionary, the first known use of the word travel was in the 14th century. It also states that the word comes from         Middle English travailen, travelen (which means to torment, labor, strive, journey) and earlier from Old French travailler (which means to work              strenuously, toil). In English we still occasionally use the words "travail", which means struggle. According to Simon Winchester in his book The Best       Travelers' Tales (2004), the words "travel" and "travail" both share an even more ancient root: a Roman instrument of torture called the tripalium (in       Latin it means "three stakes", as in to impale).</p>
    <p align=justify>Reasons for traveling include recreation, tourism or vacationing, research travel, the gathering of information, visiting people, volunteer travel        for charity, migration to begin life somewhere else, religious pilgrimages and mission trips, business travel, trade, commuting, and other reasons, such     as to obtain health care or waging or fleeing war or for the enjoyment of traveling. Travellers may use human- powered transport such as walking or          bicycling; or vehicles, such as public transport, automobiles, trains and airplanes.</p>
